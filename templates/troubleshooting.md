### Debug with Error Analysis

```
I'm encountering this error:

[PASTE ERROR MESSAGE/LOGS HERE]

Please check the Taskmaster documentation files to understand the project context.

Then:
1. Identify the most likely reason for this error
2. Provide 3 possible solutions with pros and cons for each
3. Make your recommendation about which solution is best

Please provide this analysis before implementing any code changes, so I can choose which approach to take.
```

### Code Review

```
Please review this code in the context of my project architecture documented in .taskmaster files:

```[LANGUAGE]
[PASTE CODE HERE]
```

Identify:
1. Any inconsistencies with the documented architecture

4. Best practice violations

Suggest improvements based on this analysis.
```
